> Hey, I am Bishow Kaji Shrestha

 creator of codewithbishow.com

I am completely self-taught and still trying to learn whatever I can that would help boost my career to the next level and improve my technical/personal skills.

As a side project, I decided to start a blog where I could document my programming journey and make it accessible for developers who are getting started with particular stacks similar to my area of interest.

 I write tutorials, articles, and Beginnerâ€™s Guides on C# / ASP.NET Core, Javascript, JQuery, SQL, React.Js  that you may relate to as a developer. I will make it as structured as possible so that you would find it easy to navigate across through my content.
